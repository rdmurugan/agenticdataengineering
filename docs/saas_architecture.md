# Agentic Data Engineering SaaS Architecture

## Overview
Transform the healthcare data platform into a multi-tenant SaaS offering with clear separation between control plane (management) and data plane (processing).

## Architecture Principles

### Control Plane
- **Responsibility**: Tenant management, configuration, orchestration, monitoring, billing
- **Location**: Centralized, shared across all tenants
- **Components**: APIs, UI, metadata store, billing engine, auth service

### Data Plane
- **Responsibility**: Data processing, ingestion, quality validation, storage
- **Location**: Tenant-isolated, dedicated or shared compute resources
- **Components**: Databricks workspaces, storage accounts, processing agents

## Multi-Tenancy Model

### Tenant Isolation Levels
1. **Shared Infrastructure, Isolated Data**: Cost-effective for smaller customers
2. **Dedicated Clusters, Shared Infrastructure**: Medium enterprise customers
3. **Fully Isolated**: Large enterprise/regulated customers

### Resource Allocation
- Dynamic scaling based on usage patterns
- Cost allocation and chargeback
- SLA-based resource guarantees

## Revenue Model
- **Consumption-based**: Pay per GB processed, compute hours, quality checks
- **Tiered Plans**: Starter, Professional, Enterprise
- **Add-ons**: Advanced ML features, premium support, compliance packages

## Key Differentiators
- Self-healing data pipelines reduce operational overhead
- Healthcare-specific compliance and validations
- Agentic automation reduces manual intervention
- Real-time quality monitoring and alerting
